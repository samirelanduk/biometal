Installing
----------

pip
~~~

biometal can be installed using pip:

``$ pip3 install biometal``

biometal is written for Python 3, and does not support Python 2. It currently
requires Python 3.5 and above.

If you get permission errors, try using ``sudo``:

``$ sudo pip3 install biometal``


Development
~~~~~~~~~~~

The repository for biometal, containing the most recent iteration, can be
found `here <http://github.com/samirelanduk/biometal/>`_. To clone the
biometal repository directly from there, use:

``$ git clone git://github.com/samirelanduk/biometal.git``


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

biometal relies heavily on
`atomium <https://atomium.samireland.com/>`_  - pip will install this
automatically when it installs biometal.
